# Fivem-Bridge-Decompiled

This repository contains the decompiled code for Fivem Bridge, a tool accessible via [https://fivembridge.ir/](https://fivembridge.ir/). Fivem Bridge is designed to bypass application block walls, providing users with enhanced access.

## Disclaimer

This repository is created purely for educational and exploratory purposes. I am not the original creator of Fivem Bridge and I hold no responsibility for its security or functionality. My aim is to understand and learn from the tool's workings. I appreciate the effort by the original developers, especially their implementation of an API and the decision not to store user information.

## Purpose of this Repository

The primary objective of this repository is to analyze and comprehend the logic behind Fivem Bridge, particularly focusing on its approach to handling the host file. There are key areas where improvements can be made:

1. **Host File Management**: The original tool removes the existing host file and creates a new one. This can disrupt users who have customized their host files for other applications or content filtering. A better approach would be to append necessary addresses to the end of the existing host file, preserving user modifications.

2. **Security Enhancements**: While the tool's current implementation is functional, there are potential enhancements to consider. For example, securing data handling processes to protect user privacy and prevent misuse.

3. **Understanding and Improvement**: By sharing this decompiled code, I encourage others to delve into its logic and contribute suggestions for improvements, particularly focusing on security and efficiency.

Feel free to explore the code and propose enhancements.
