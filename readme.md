# Fivem-Bridge-Decompiled

This repository contains the decompiled code for Fivem-Bridge, a website available at [https://fivembridge.ir/](https://fivembridge.ir/).

## Disclaimer

I don't fight it, it's just for fun.
I want to clarify that I am not the creator of this tool. I am simply exploring it out of curiosity. However, I really appreciate the work done by the creators, especially the fact that they have an API and do not store user information.

## Purpose of this Repository

The main reason for creating this repository is to understand why the creators initially attempted to remove the host file and create a new one. I believe it would be better to edit and add addresses at the end of the host file, rather than removing them. This way, users who have already made modifications to the host file for other applications or to block/re-route certain content won't be affected.

Feel free to explore the code.
